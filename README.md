BASIC MACHINE LEARNING CONCEPTS USING PYTHON

About This Project:
I tried to understand the basic ideas behind ML algorithms and write simple Python code.
Everything is in one file to keep it easy.

Why I Made This Project:
*To learn Machine Learning step by step.
*To practice Python coding,
*To prepare for exams and viva.
*To understand how algorithms make predictions and decisions.

Tools Used:
*Python
*VS Code 
*Only basic Python, no complicated libraries

Algorithms in This Project:

1️⃣ Linear Regression

Predicts numbers like marks or prices.
Example: Predict marks from study hours.
Simple line equation is used to guess new marks.

2️⃣ Logistic Regression

Predicts Yes/No or Pass/Fail.
Example: Check if a student passes based on marks.
Uses a simple if–else rule.

3️⃣ Confusion Matrix

Shows where predictions are correct or wrong.
Example: Compare actual result vs predicted result.
Helps to see mistakes clearly.

4️⃣ Decision Tree

Decides step by step using questions.
Example: Approve or reject a loan based on age and income.
Uses simple if–else logic.

5️⃣ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Classifies new data based on nearest examples.
Example: Classify student as Weak or Strong based on nearby marks.
Looks at closest data to decide.

What I Learned:
*Difference between prediction and classification
*How each algorithm works
*How to write simple Python code for ML
*How to understand ML using real-life examples

Conclusion:
This project helped me understand the basics of Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Confusion Matrix, Decision Tree, and KNN using simple Python code.
It taught me that Machine Learning is about logic and patterns, not just formulas.
Overall, it was a fun and useful learning experience that gave me confidence to explore more.
